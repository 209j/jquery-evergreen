# jQuery Evergreen

Small & fast DOM and event library for modern browsers.
Having the same familiar API as jQuery (but without the extra "weight" of modules like `$.ajax`, `$.animate`, and `$.Deferred`), it works great stand-alone or paired up with e.g. Backbone.
The full version is only 7KB minified (2KB gzip), but it's easy to create a custom build to exclude parts you don't need.
